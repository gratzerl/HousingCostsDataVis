<h1 mat-dialog-title>Development of housing costs</h1>
<div mat-dialog-content>
  <p>
    This data visualization project tries to highlight how the share of housing costs has developed over the last 10
    years, from 2010 to 2019. It also shows how the share of housing cost and the share of ownership are related.

    <h2 class="heading">How to read the charts</h2>
    <p>
      The visualtization can be split into two parts: the ciruclar bar charts and a bubble chart.<br />
      The data in the explanatory circular bar chart is not real but random values for demonstration purposes only.

      <p>
        You can switch between the different income groups "Above 60% median equalized income", and "Below 60% median
        equalized income", or view the average for both groups. 60% is the at-risk-of poverty rate.

            For each European country a ciruclar bar chart displays the share of the housing costs of the country's
            average disposable income for the years from 2010-2019.<br /><br />

            When hovering over a bar the percentage and the year are displayed.<br />
            Clicking on a bar zooms in to the chart and the housing costs composition is displayed, showing how the
            housing costs for this year are made up. <br /><br />
            Clicking outside of the zoomed chart or on the close button in the upper right corner will unzoom it.

      <h3 class="heading">Bubble chart</h3>
      <p>
        The x-axis of the bubble chart is the share of people who own the dwelling they live in, while the y-axis is the
        share of housing costs in relation to the country's mean income.<br />
        The size of the bubble represents the average gdp for the respective country.<br /><br />
        Hovering over a bubble will display the average gdp in Euros. Clicking on a bubble expands the according
        circular bar chart.

    <h2 class="heading">Most important terms</h2>
    <div class="term-explanation">
      <h4 class="heading">Income</h4>
      <p>The total disposable income of a household is calculated by adding together the personal income received by all
        of household members plus income received at household level. Missing income information is imputed.
        The disposable household income includes all income from work (employee wages and self-employment earnings).
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="term-explanation">
      <h4 class="heading">Household</h4>
      <p>
        A 'private household' means "a person living alone or a group of people who live together in the same private
        dwelling and share expenditures, including the joint provision of the essentials of living". EU-SILC
        implementing regulation number 1983/2003 on updated definitions, defines households in terms of sharing
        household expenses and (for non-permanent members) in terms of duration of stay and (for temporarily absent
        members) in terms of duration of absence.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="term-explanation">
      <h4 class="heading">Houshold type</h4>
      <p>
        A common classification was developed by Eurostat for use in data collection surveys including ECHP, LFS, HBS
        and EU-SILC as well as the subsequent presentation of indicators relating to income, housing, education,
        healthcare, etc. Rather than focussing on "couples" and/or "families", the classification is constructed by
        reference to the numbers of adult members, their age and gender, and the numbers of dependent children living
        with them.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="term-explanation">
      <h4 class="heading">Housing costs</h4>
      <p>
        The total amount of money spent on housing expenditures (e. rent, maintenance, electricity etc.) in absolute
        figures as well as propotional to income.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="term-explanation">
      <h4 class="heading">Actual rentals</h4>
      <p>
        Rentals are all rentals actually paid by tenants, i.e. the rentals the tenant pays to the landlord regardless of
        any social benefits the tenant receives from public authorities (including payments which at the tenant's
        discretion go directly to the landlord). Rentals normally include payment for the use of the land on which the
        property stands, the dwelling occupied, the fixtures and fittings for heating, plumbing, lighting, etc., and, in
        the case of a dwelling let furnished, the furniture.
        <br /> <br />
        Rentals also include payment for the use of a garage to provide parking in connection with the dwelling. The
        garage does not have to be physically contiguous to the dwelling; nor does it have to be leased from the same
        landlord.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="term-explanation">
      <h4 class="heading">Imputed rentals</h4>
      <p>
        I. e. money that one saves on full (market) rent by living in one's own accommodation or in accommodation
        rented at a price that is lower than the market rent.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="term-explanation">
      <h4 class="heading">Median equalized income</h4>
      <p>
        Is a measure of household income that takes account of the differences in a household's size and composition,
        and thus is equivalised or made equivalent for all household sizes and compositions. It is used for the
        calculation of poverty and social exclusion indicators.<br />
        The equivalised income is calculated by dividing the householdâ€™s total income from all sources by its equivalent
        size, which is calculated using the modified OECD equivalence scale. This scale attributes a weight to all
        members of the household:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>1.0 to the first adult</li>
        <li>0.5 to the second and each subsequent person aged 14 and over</li>
        <li>0.3 to each child aged under 14</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The equivalent size is the sum of the weights of all the members of a given household.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="term-explanation">
      <h4 class="heading">Equalized income</h4>
      <p>
        The equivalised disposable income is the total income of a household, after tax and other deductions, that is
        available for spending or saving, divided by the number of household members converted into equalised adults;
        household members are equalised or made equivalent by weighting each according to their age, using the so-called
        modified OECD equivalence scale.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="term-explanation">
      <h4 class="heading">At-risk-of-poverty rate</h4>
      <p>
        The at-risk-of-poverty rate is the share of people with an equivalised disposable income (after social transfer)
        below the at-risk-of-poverty threshold, which is set at 60 % of the national median equivalised disposable
        income after social transfers.<br />

        This indicator does not measure wealth or poverty, but low income in comparison to other residents in that
        country, which does not necessarily imply a low standard of living.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="term-explanation">
      <h4 class="heading">Disposable income</h4>
      <p>
        Household disposable income is the total amount of money households have available for spending and saving after
        subtracting income taxes and pension contributions.
